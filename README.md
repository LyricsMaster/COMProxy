COMProxy
=========================

About
--------------------

When using ActiveX (COM/OLE) objects in Xojo, you cannot use reference of ActiveX objects (that are auto-generated by Xojo) in method signatures or type of properties that may be referenced from platform other than Windows.

If you do so, Xojo build apps that tries to link against `oleaut32` library, even if you're not on Windows.

How To Use
--------------------

1. Import COMProxy module to your project.
2. Within your auto-generated ActiveX module code:

   - Replace all `COM.SysAllocString` with `COMProxy.SysAllocString`
   - Replace all `COM.SysFreeString` with `COMProxy.SysFreeString`

License
--------------------

You can use this module for free both in commercial or non-commercial projects.

If possible, please vote to the Feedback Case #31791 (`feedback://showreport?report_id=31791`) to encourage Xojo to fix this issue without dirty workaround like this.
